    '''
    This function takes the output from the mvpa_dataprep and partitions the data
    for further cross-validation procedure.
    For each partition fold a feature reduction step is performed:
    The feature Selection Step performs a One-way ANOVA for each feature.
    Only includes feature if p < 0.05
    When a fetuare is included is z-normalized!
    
    [data] = mvpa_datapartiation(k,prepdata)
    
    WHERE:
    PREPDATA is the output from the mvpa_dataprep
    CFG is a structure whit the following definitions:
    
    cfg.fold = number of partitions to be performed in the data.
    
    The OUTPUT will be a structure with the following fields:
    DATA.numclassifier	= is the number of timebins read from the data,
                          corresponds to the number of different classifiers that will be trained.
    DATA.fold			= is the number of partitions.
    DATA.classifier     = is a structure with as many fields as timebins.
                          In each DATA.classifier field there is a structure corresponding
                          to each partition fold with the following information stored:
